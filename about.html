      Working in Tech Support the situation in which the best answer to a user’s questions is “no”, does indeed arise. Coinciding is the occasional need to a correct a mistake. As an example of this, just this past week I received a somewhat frantic support request ticket from a user that described their problem in using the trackpad on their laptop. The user typically used a USB mouse with their device, however prepping for a meeting outside their office and noticed that the trackpad was not working. I received the Zendesk notification for the request on my phone, while working with a different user at their desk. Just as I finished reading the notification, the user’s who’s desk I was sitting at, asked me to diagnose an issue they were having with streaming music from their device. Knowing that the ticket request was impending and required quick attention for the sake of the requestor’s meeting, I told the second requestor that I had to first help the other with their track pad issue (essentially telling them “no, I can;t help with your request regarding streaming at this time”). Luckily, the second requestor was understanding and saw the reason for me delaying support.

      In regards to the first request, I had a diagnosis for the trackpad issue in mind, knowing there is a common mistake made by users with that laptop model (HP 450 G1). As I suspected, the trackpad was showing an amber LED indicator in the corner, meaning the user had inadvertently locked the trackpad by double-tapping the upper right corner. I showed the user it was a very easy thing to do unknowingly and how it could be helpful in the right context. The user was relived to know it was a very quick solution and would not hinder their quickly upcoming meeting. After helping solve the support request for the track pad issue, I was then able to help the second requester with their music streaming issue, in a timely manner.
