                      <p class="section-paragraph">
                        I'm Michael. I am a husband, father, and <a href="http://www.audible.com/" target="_blank">Audible</a> addict, living in Southern California. I dearly love my family,
                        love to learn, love to work, and love Lord of the Rings. I currently work full time for <a href="http://www.formationtech.com/" target="_blank">Formation Technologies</a>
                        as a support agent and graphic designer. I also work as an independent contractor for <a href="http://revdmediagroup.com/" target="_blank">Rev'd Media</a>, helping to
                        lead their publication <a href="http://slamdmag.com/" target="_blank">Slam'd Magazine</a>. In addition to these efforts in my career path, I am a full-time
                        Graphic Design student and maintain a small, but steady number of freelance design projects. Hy hobbies
                        coincide pretty closely with my work. I thoroughly enjoy drawing, writing, and exploring new art projects.
                        To be honest, I’m not sure how to go about continuing to describing myself. I could list favorite artists
                        or movies (Kendrick Lamar and Jaws), talk about my dog (Strider is the most amazing husky in the universe),
                        or recount pivotal life moments that may have shaped me as a person (not really that exciting), but none of
                        that feels particularly natural. Instead I think its helpful to just state what my passion boils down to as
                        plainly as possible.
                        <br><br>
                        I feel inescapably tied to the human need for creative expression. Each and every soul is uniquely capable of expressing itself.
                        For me its takes on a variety of outlets revolving around design and arts.
                        Nevertheless, the confidence I have in this framework of how to view life, has led me to work in a tech support
                        role. I like technology a lot and I love design, but more importantly, feeling as though I know how I ought
                        to express myself as a human, I operate in a vocation which allows me to help others do the same. Currently
                        managing a Helpdesk for educational clients means that day in and out, I am aiding teachers and other school
                        faculty to use their tech tools to the best of their abilities, in order to carry out their passion for
                        education. Helping people do what they love, in efficient and fluid ways, is what makes me love my job. Its
                        also why I think I would be an excellent fit for the position of Customer Success Specialist.

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Explain a scenario where you had to tell a customer “no” or had to correct their mistake</h3>
                      <p class="section-paragraph">
                        Working in Tech Support, the situation in which the best answer to a user’s questions is “no” does indeed arise.
                        Coinciding is the fairly regular need to a correct a mistake. As an example of this, just this past week I received
                        a somewhat frantic support request ticket from a user, describing a problem with the trackpad of their laptop.
                        This user typically uses a USB mouse with their device, however while prepping for a meeting outside their office,
                        they noticed that the trackpad was not working. I received the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/" target="_blank">Zendesk</a> notification for the request on my phone,
                        while working with a different user at their desk. Just as I finished reading the notification, the user’s
                        who’s desk I was sitting at, asked me to diagnose an issue they were having with streaming music from their
                        device. Knowing that the the ticket notification I had just recieved required quick attention for the sake of the
                        requestor’s meeting, I told the second requestor that I had to first help the other with their track pad issue
                        (essentially telling them “no, I can't help with your request regarding streaming at this time”). Luckily, the
                        second requestor was understanding and saw the reason for me delaying support.
                        <br><br>
                        In regards to the first request, I had a diagnosis for the trackpad issue in mind, knowing there is a common
                        mistake made by users with that <a href="http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/readIndex?sp4ts.oid=5405166" target="_blank">laptop model</a>. As I suspected, the trackpad was showing an amber
                        LED indicator in the corner, meaning the user had inadvertently locked the trackpad by double-tapping the upper
                        right corner. I showed the user it was a very easy thing to do unknowingly and how it could be helpful in the
                        right context. The user was relived to know it was a very quick solution and would not hinder their quickly appraoching
                        meeting. After helping solve the support request for the track pad issue, I was then able to help the second requester
                        with their music streaming issue, in a timely manner.

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Do you believe the customer is always right?</h3>
                      <p class="section-paragraph">
                        Whether or not a customer is always right, is a fairly commonplace question in the Tech Support industry.
                        With my particular experience, mostly working with educational and small business clients, equally common
                        place seems to be the notion that “tech guys” are the first to point out when a customer or user is not right.
                        In an effort to combat negative stereotype of the mutant nerd sitting across the Helpdesk, I pursue balancing
                        a “customer is always attitude” with some technological realism, to build trust and light-heartedness as it
                        relates to tech support.
                        <br><br>
                        Just yesterday in fact, a user was having trouble locating the contents of a google doc they had been trying
                        to copy and paste. According to the user they highlighted the text and then, “it all deleted itself”. Knowing
                        that computers don’t do such things of their own accord, I figured a simple missed keystroke was to blame and
                        this was just basic user error. In this case, the customer was not right. That didn’t really matter though.
                        The point of my role in the scenario was not to press the user until they admited fault for a miniscule error that
                        anyone is capable of making, but to show them a simple and helpful solution. I showed the user the Google
                        Doc Edit History feature and we were able to restore to a previous version containing the full contents of
                        their document. I then helped the user copy and paste the contents they way they had originally intended.
                        <br><br>
                        There are certainly cases where a customer may be in the wrong, but very rarely in the context of tech support
                        does the case call for me to point it out. As the question pertains to customer service in areas of sales,
                        retail, and purchases, the answer is similar however varies slightly. In my opinion it is better for a
                        service/goods provider to assume fault in regards to customer service issues and go above in beyond in order
                        to make amends for the problem and/or inconvenience. A genuine apology and effort to rectify a problem are
                        invaluable means of customer satisfaction and retention. A company who invests in people invests in its own
                        success.

                    <h3 class="section-heading">FIRE ALARM: Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?</h3>
                      <p class="section-paragraph">
                        Upon logging in to start my workday and seeing a large number of emails from distraught customers, my first order
                        of business would be to throw on a comically large head-set, take a drawn-out sip of coffee while maintaining eye contact with my monitor
                        , quietly and raspily say, “buckle-up” to no one in particular,
                        and then smash the big button on my desk that triggers sirens, strobe lights, and signifies the situation being
                        elevated to DEFCON 5. Just kidding.
                        <br><br>
                        In reality, I would skim the emails in my inbox and try and access whether or not there is a common thread
                        amongst the many problems. If all the request seem to be stemming from the same root issue, I would then as
                        quickly as possible work in concentric support steps to diagnose the problem. If multiple users are having
                        the same issue, its fair to assume it is not a user-end problem. From there, determine where the problem is
                        most likely originating from. At this point I would reach out to other support team members to either see
                        if they are receiving similar emails and if not to give them a potential warning. I would then reach out
                        to the development team to see if they are aware that users are experiencing a problem and if so, what may
                        be causing it. Once I have some hard facts to report, I would begin replying to all of the distraught
                        customers in the order in which they were received. With calm and concise replies, I would state that we are aware
                        of the problem, actively seeking to resolve and prevent it, and most importantly deeply apologetic for any
                        inconveniences and interruptions. I would then balance my efforts between offering follow up support to
                        customers as their replies came in, preemptive support where applicable, and aiding other
                        teams in anyway I can to help resolve the issues.
                        <br><br>
                        If it happened that the many emails were actually unrelated and there were several coincidental cases of
                        customers needing serious support, I would asses which customers problems and circumstances demanded the
                        highest priorities. I would then respond to each email in turn, letting them know we would be offering our help as
                        quickly as possible. Then, for the highest priority issue I would begin support. If appropriate
                        I would reach out to other members of the support team and let them know that there was a high volume of

                        Recently I purchased a new outdoor Dog Run for my husky, Strider. I began the process by determining what I
                        was looking for specifically and searching on google an item that included the most important features. After
                        searching “dog kennel 6ft” I used the google shopping tab to order the search results with accompanying
                        images. I then looked for a dog run that was 6ft high and combined the best price, customer rating, and
                        overall size for our needs. After finding the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/36442142" target="_blank">specific
                        product</a> I wanted, I then did a second google search of the specific item to find a possibly cheaper price for
                        it. Determining that Walmart had the best overall price, including taxes and shipping, I placed it in my online
                        cart. In the checkout section, the Google Chrome App,
                        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/honey/bmnlcjabgnpnenekpadlanbbkooimhnj?hl=en-US" target="_blank">
                        Honey</a> then automatically searched for and applied any available coupon codes to further reduce the price.
                        I then placed the order knowing I got the best possible online price for the item that combined all of the
                        necessary features in an outdoor dog run for our pup.
